## About This Project

This repository is my fork of a collaborative final project for my Intro to Modern Graphics Programming class at Champlain College. The goal was to build a 3D graphics application in C++ from scratch.

* **Teammate:** [Andrew Genualdo](https://github.com/AndrewGenualdo)

## My Key Contributions

As part of the two-person team, my primary responsibilities and key contributions included:

* **Foundational Rendering System:** Architected and implemented an independent, foundational rendering system. For the final submission, elements of my system were merged with my teammate's. My original, complete rendering system can be viewed [in my personal fork of the project here](https://github.com/zebenbrown/gpr200-fa2024-zeben-brown).
* **Planetary Simulation:** Engineered the mathematics to accurately simulate the orbital mechanics and rotation of the planetary rings.
* **Text Rendering:** Developed a text rendering system to display dynamic information and UI elements on the screen.
